### Hey there!

Back to working on my website because I got bored and you can't play valorant forever (smh)
Need tips on how to improve the look of my website, it's so plain right now. I'm thinking of adding a background effect/flare, but not sure exactly what.
Another issue is the disclaimer on the main page. I mainly just want to include my website email and some legal copyright, but I've never done this before so uhhh...

Anyways enjoy ***navigation buttons*** in blogs :3
