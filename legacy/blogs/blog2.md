Happy 2024 everyone!
I've added a couple changes in this update:
- Replaced the dropdown menu with a top bar navigation menu for better ux
- Better code and file structure

Stay tuned for more updates as I'm not done yet!
Signing off,
Your favourite self-proclaimed developer :D

Edit:
Pretty big updates but didn't feel like making a new blog
- Projects page finally has something in it
- Mobile support for the navigation bar
