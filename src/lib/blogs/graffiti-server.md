I kind of forgot I have a blog...

*Anyways*

# I did some graffiti!!
And I'm going to document my whole process of how I did it here because why not

### Some well needed context:
I've been interested in graffiti culture and just overall doing it in my notebooks and in digital art already. So I just randomly got the idea to do it on my homelab server!

## Supplies
- Perm colored markers
- My server
- My sketch notebook

## Sketch
First thing we definitely need to do before this is a proper sketch - not just gonna ball it straight onto my server with permanent markers lmfao

## Sketch, but on the server
This was a bit of a struggle since you could only see the graphite of the pencil only if you angled the source of light in a very specific manner

## Fill
Pretty self explanatory. Just putting the fill on first and letting it dry before the actual lineart

## Lineart
Flunked it a bit and I kept putting my hand on wet paint for no reason ;-;

## Finished result
A couple extra touches after the paint has dried and huzzah!

Personally I like it quite a lot and am definitely planning on doing this again!


### Thats all folks!
Thanks for reading if you made it to the end :3

See you in the next blog!
