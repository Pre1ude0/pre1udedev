Recently, while talking to my friend [Chase](https://diegoeinarsterling.straw.page/), he showed me this cool app called ["Purrr"](https://www.hipurrrr.com/), a stray cat feeder camera livestream network based on a multitude of feeders in China. Now what I found incredible about this app was that it's not just a camera browser, but instead made like a social media with follows, comments and all sorts of networking features. The best part of the app is that you get to feed the cats live and see them eat the food that you've sent them - there's a  currency named "Kibble" (yes the currency is literally just cat food) and you can use it to give kibble or snacks to the feeder that you're watching, letting you bond with the cat at feeder on the other side of the world.

Now that I've piqued your attention, I'm going to tell you a bit more about the app itself and the movement behind it and how incredibly well the developers behind the app have monetized it.

## Purr App & Stray cat feeding stations
The [vision of Purrr](https://www.hipurrrr.com/our-vision) is to quote: "we envision a world where every stray cat is met with compassion and care" via "innovative technology and science-backed solutions", but what are these solutions?

### Introducing: The cat feeder 3000!!

Jokes aside, this is the **"Hello Cat feeder"**, a technology made by a Chinese company called ["Hello"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_(Chinese_company)), which, interestingly enough, has primarily been known for e-bikes until now. The feeders were launched alongside the aforementioned Purr or "Hello Street cat" app developed by [Guangxi Hachong Network Technology](https://streetcat.wiki/index.php/Hello_Street_Cat), launching on April 13th, 2023, at first only available in China under the name of "JieMao".

The app is also part of the [TNR (Trap, Neuter, Return)](https://streetcat.wiki/index.php/TNR) program - humanely trapping stray cats, neutering them and releasing them back into the wild with a hole punched into their ear (this doesn't harm the cat and is used to identify what cats are and aren't neutered). This reduces the wild breeding that is causing the number of stray cats to spike. Purr lets users donate and fund said operations, returning live updates about the status of the cat individual that you've donated towards right on the app.

These feeders come equipped with three cameras: top, front (of the feeder) and back. Via the app you can then watch a livestream of said cameras. Not only that but you can also interact with the cats on the other side of the livestream by donating and seeing the food you've just purchased for the cat dispense in the bowl, and suddenly you’re way more willing to donate, because you literally see the food drop into the bowl for a cat you’ve accidentally fallen in love with (because who can resist the pleading look of a hungry cat).

### Comparison to other movements
This, combined with social features like comment sections under each livestream, notifications when a cat appears at a feeder you follow, and a global donor leaderboard, in my opinion, immediately becomes way more appealing than the usual non-profit stray cat support movements promising change with more than 77,000+ active users on the platform.

Currently the movement only has feeders in China, but they're branching out to America with the first feeders being deployed there at the time of writing.

### Stats
Here are some numbers that show how far the app has come in just two years.
- _21,110+_ active cat feeders deployed
- Registered _136,000+_ stray cats in their system
- Neutered _67,000+_ strays through TNR programs

## Conclusion
**GO DONATE!!!**

The app is free to download on both the [Apple App store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/purrrr-feed-rescue-stray-cats/id6475722361) and the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hello.purr&hl=en) with both paid options for feeding cats and free daily credits and tasks you can perform (like following them on social media, etc.) to make an impact for free!

There's also a very neat alternative viewer for said live streams on other platforms, such as pc, called [meow.camera](https://meow.camera) developed by [imput](https://imput.net) (Felt like giving them a shoutout x3)
